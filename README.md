🚀 Power BI Dashboard Project – Blinkit Grocery App Analytics 📊

I’m excited to share my recent project where I built a Power BI Dashboard for the Blinkit Grocery App, a leading quick-commerce platform in India. This project was focused on analyzing customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends to drive better business decisions.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:

Developed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI

Analyzed key metrics such as daily/weekly sales trends, top-selling categories, and delivery time efficiency

Implemented filters and slicers for region-wise and category-wise analysis

Designed KPIs to track revenue, order count, and customer retention

Provided actionable insights to improve inventory management and marketing strategies

🛠 Skills & Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Data Cleaning | Data Modeling | Data Visualization

This project helped me strengthen my data storytelling and dashboard design skills, and I’m looking forward to applying these insights in real-world business cases.

📌 Feel free to check out the dashboard and let me know your thoughts or suggestions!
